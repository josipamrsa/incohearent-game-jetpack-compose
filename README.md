# Incohearent Game App

A digital version of the popular **Incohearent** card game, built with **Jetpack Compose** for Android client and **Ktor** for the backend. This app brings the fun and hilarity of the physical game to your mobile devices, allowing players to enjoy the game remotely with friends or by themselves.

## About Incohearent
**Incohearent** is a party game that challenges players to decipher phrases made of incoherent, gibberish-like words into understandable phrases or expressions. Each card contains a seemingly nonsensical set of words, but when spoken aloud, the real phrase begins to emerge.

Players have a limited time to guess the correct phrase based on phonetic clues. The game is fun for gatherings, whether you're a word game enthusiast or just looking to laugh out loud with friends.
